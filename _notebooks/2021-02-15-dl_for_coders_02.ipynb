    "The six lines of code we saw in the last chapter are just one small part of the process of using deep learning in practice. In this chapter, we're going to use a computer vision example to look at the end-to-end process of creating a deep learning application. More specifically, we're going to build a bear classifier! In the process, we'll discuss the capabilities and constraints of deep learning, explore how to create datasets, look at possible gotchas when using deep learning in practice, and more. Many of the key points will apply equally well to other deep learning problems, such as those in last chapter. If you work through a problem similar in key respects to our example problems, we expect you to get excellent results with little code, quickly."

    "\n",
    "We often talk to people who underestimate both the constraints and the capabilities of deep learning. Both of these can be problems: underestimating the capabilities means that you might not even try things that could be very beneficial, and underestimating the constraints might mean that you fail to consider and react to important issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing to do is to keep an open mind. Then, it is possible to design a process where you can find the specific capabilities and constraints related to your particular problem as you work through the process. This doesn't mean making any risky bets — we will show you how you can gradually roll out models so that they don't create significant risks, and can even backtest them prior to putting them in production."

    "One thing to be aware of in this process: as we discussed in the last chapter, models can only reflect the data used to train them. And the world is full of biased data, which ends up reflected in, for example, Bing Image Search. For instance, let's say you were interested in creating an app that could help users figure out whether they had healthy skin, so you trained a model on the results of searches for \"healthy skin\". Here's the kinds of results you would get: "
